## 🤖 Built with Antigravity

> This project is a showcase of **AI-assisted vibe coding** using [Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev) by Google DeepMind.
>
> Every component — from the dark glassmorphism UI to the Xtream Codes API integration, multilingual localization system, hardware-accelerated MPV backend, auto-reconnect logic, EPG panel, and the full playlist manager — was designed, written, debugged, and refined through natural-language conversation with Antigravity.
>
> No boilerplate generators were used. No copy-paste from StackOverflow. Just a developer describing what they want, and an AI building it — iteratively, cleanly, and completely.
